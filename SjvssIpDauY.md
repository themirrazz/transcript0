# Apples and Androids and CRASH - holy shit I dropped my apple

```
themirrazz:
  Until they tell to stop, or ask "What the heck is going on? My
  phone's vibrating!" And then say, "Oh, do you want me to stop
  that?"

[themirrazz tosses the apple up into the air.]

themirrazz:
  Whoo.

[themirrazz continues tossing the apple.]

themirrazz:
  Whoo!
  I could do this all...

[The apple starts bouncing in themirrazz' hand, falls out and knocks over a cup of water.]

themirrazz:
  くそー！(kusō!)

[themirrazz walks over to the apple to pick it up, which now has an indent.]

themirrazz:
  Dammit!
